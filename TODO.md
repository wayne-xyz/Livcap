# TODO: Window Reopen Crash Investigation & Fix Plan

## üö® Critical Issue: EXC_BAD_ACCESS on Window Reopen

### Issue Summary
- **Primary Problem**: Application crashes with `EXC_BAD_ACCESS (code=1, address=0x10)` when closing and reopening window
- **Secondary Issues**: 
  - ViewBridge disconnection errors
  - Title bar reappearing on reopen despite borderless configuration
  - Audio system state corruption

### Error Patterns

#### 1. EXC_BAD_ACCESS Crash
```
Thread 1: EXC_BAD_ACCESS (code=1, address=0x10)
```
- **When**: Only on window REOPEN, not initial launch
- **Location**: Audio processing pipeline (AVAudioEngine ‚Üî SFSpeechRecognizer)

#### 2. ViewBridge Error
```
ViewBridge to RemoteViewService Terminated: Error Domain=com.apple.ViewBridge Code=18 "(null)" 
UserInfo={
  com.apple.ViewBridge.error.hint=this process disconnected remote view controller -- benign unless unexpected,
  com.apple.ViewBridge.error.description=NSViewBridgeErrorCanceled
}
```

#### 3. Window Style Loss
- Title bar reappears on window reopen
- `.windowStyle(.hiddenTitleBar)` not persisting across WindowGroup instances

## üîç Root Cause Analysis

### Technical Architecture Issues

#### 1. Audio Engine State Management Problem
**Issue**: Incomplete cleanup of imperative audio objects in declarative SwiftUI lifecycle

**Details**:
- `AVAudioEngine` audio tap remains installed after window close
- `SFSpeechRecognitionTask` continues running in background
- Audio buffers have dangling references
- New window instance accesses deallocated memory from previous session

**Evidence**:
```swift
// Current cleanup in CaptionView.onDisappear:
if caption.isRecording {
    caption.toggleRecording()  // ‚ùå Only stops recording, doesn't clean up engine
}
```

#### 2. SwiftUI WindowGroup Lifecycle Mismatch
**Issue**: WindowGroup creates new instances on reopen, losing previous state

**Details**:
- SwiftUI expects stateless view recreation
- Audio engine requires explicit imperative cleanup
- Window styling configurations don't persist
- State management assumes clean initialization

#### 3. System Service Integration Conflict
**Issue**: Borderless window configuration confuses macOS window management

**Details**:
- ViewBridge manages system UI elements (title bars, toolbars)
- Non-standard window styling creates service coordination problems
- Remote view controller lifecycle becomes inconsistent
- System defaults override custom configurations on recreation

### Memory Corruption Chain

```
1. First Launch:
   ‚úÖ Clean state, AVAudioEngine initializes properly
   ‚úÖ SFSpeechRecognizer creates recognition task
   ‚úÖ ViewBridge establishes proper connections

2. Window Close:
   ‚ùå CaptionView.onDisappear() calls toggleRecording()
   ‚ùå toggleRecording() calls stopRecording()
   ‚ùå stopRecording() stops audioEngine but doesn't remove taps
   ‚ùå Audio buffers and callbacks remain in memory
   ‚ùå ViewBridge connections not properly terminated

3. Window Reopen:
   ‚ùå New CaptionView instance created
   ‚ùå New CaptionViewModel tries to initialize audio
   ‚ùå Conflicts with existing audio tap installations
   ‚ùå Memory access to deallocated buffers ‚Üí EXC_BAD_ACCESS
   ‚ùå ViewBridge conflicts between old/new connections
   ‚ùå Window styling reverts to system defaults
```

## üéØ Fix Strategy & Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Audio Engine Lifecycle Fix (High Priority)

#### 1.1 Complete Audio Cleanup Implementation
**File**: `CaptionViewModel.swift`

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Add proper `deinit()` method to CaptionViewModel
- [ ] Implement complete audio engine teardown in `stopRecording()`
- [ ] Remove all audio taps explicitly: `inputNode.removeTap(onBus: 0)`
- [ ] Cancel and nil out recognition task: `recognitionTask?.cancel(); recognitionTask = nil`
- [ ] Stop and nil audio engine: `audioEngine?.stop(); audioEngine = nil`
- [ ] Nil out recognition request: `recognitionRequest = nil`

**Implementation**:
```swift
// Add to CaptionViewModel
deinit {
    cleanupAudioResources()
}

private func cleanupAudioResources() {
    // Cancel recognition task
    recognitionTask?.cancel()
    recognitionTask = nil
    
    // Remove audio taps
    audioEngine?.inputNode.removeTap(onBus: 0)
    
    // Stop and cleanup audio engine
    audioEngine?.stop()
    audioEngine = nil
    
    // Cleanup recognition request
    recognitionRequest?.endAudio()
    recognitionRequest = nil
}
```

#### 1.2 Enhanced Window Close Handling
**File**: `CaptionView.swift`

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Enhance `onDisappear` to call complete cleanup
- [ ] Add explicit audio resource cleanup before view destruction
- [ ] Ensure cleanup happens even on forced window termination

### Phase 2: Window Management Fix (Medium Priority)

#### 2.1 Persistent Window Styling
**File**: `LivcapApp.swift`

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Research SwiftUI window state persistence
- [ ] Implement custom window management to maintain borderless state
- [ ] Consider using NSWindow directly for better control
- [ ] Add window restoration handling

#### 2.2 ViewBridge Integration Fix
**Tasks**:
- [ ] Research ViewBridge lifecycle best practices for borderless windows
- [ ] Implement proper cleanup coordination with system services
- [ ] Consider alternative borderless implementation approaches
- [ ] Test with different macOS versions for compatibility

### Phase 3: Architecture Improvement (Long-term)

#### 3.1 Audio System Abstraction
**Tasks**:
- [ ] Create dedicated AudioManager singleton
- [ ] Separate audio lifecycle from UI lifecycle
- [ ] Implement proper resource management patterns
- [ ] Add audio session state validation

#### 3.2 Window Management Service
**Tasks**:
- [ ] Create WindowManager for consistent styling
- [ ] Implement window state persistence
- [ ] Handle multi-window scenarios properly
- [ ] Coordinate with system services appropriately

#### 2. Audio System Tests
- [ ] Start recording ‚Üí Audio engine initializes
- [ ] Stop recording ‚Üí Complete cleanup

- [ ] Initial launch ‚Üí Borderless window
- [ ] Close/reopen ‚Üí Maintains borderless style
- [ ] Multiple reopens ‚Üí Consistent appearance
- [ ] System integration ‚Üí No ViewBridge errors

### Debugging Tools

- [ ] Monitor for retain cycles

#### Audio Debugging
