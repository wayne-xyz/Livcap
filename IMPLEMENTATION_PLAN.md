# WhisperLive-Style Overlapping Windows Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document tracks the implementation of the WhisperLive-style overlapping windows approach for real-time speech recognition in Livcap.

## Phase 1: Core Infrastructure ✅
- [x] Create implementation plan
- [x] **AudioWindow.swift** - Data structure for audio windows
- [x] **TranscriptionUpdate.swift** - Data structure for transcription updates
- [x] **OverlappingBufferManager.swift** - Manages 3s sliding windows with 1s step
- [x] **StreamingWhisperTranscriber.swift** - Handles overlapping transcription
- [x] **Test Implementation** - OverlappingCaptionViewModel and OverlappingTestView

## Phase 2: Word-Level Processing ✅
- [x] **WordLevelDiffing.swift** - Extracts new words from overlapping results
- [x] **LocalAgreementPolicy.swift** - Implements LocalAgreement-2 stabilization
- [x] **RealTimeCaptionViewModel.swift** - Updated ViewModel for overlapping approach
- [x] **RealTimeCaptionView.swift** - Updated UI for word-by-word display

## Phase 3: Integration & Optimization
- [ ] **AudioManager Integration** - Update AudioManager for streaming
- [ ] **Performance Optimization** - Concurrent processing and memory management
- [ ] **Error Handling** - Robust error handling for overlapping pipeline
- [ ] **UI Polish** - Smooth animations and transitions

## Phase 4: Testing & Validation
- [ ] **Unit Tests** - Test overlapping buffer logic
- [ ] **Integration Tests** - Test full pipeline
- [ ] **Performance Tests** - Measure latency and accuracy
- [ ] **User Testing** - Real-world usage validation

## Phase 5: Production Ready
- [ ] **Code Review** - Final code review and cleanup
- [ ] **Documentation** - API documentation and usage guides
- [ ] **Release Preparation** - Merge to main branch
- [ ] **Deployment** - Production deployment

## Current Status: Phase 2 Complete ✅ - READY FOR INTEGRATION
**Progress: 8/18 tasks completed (44%)**

### What's Ready for Integration:
1. **Core Infrastructure**: All data structures and managers implemented
2. **Word-Level Processing**: Advanced diffing and stabilization algorithms
3. **Enhanced UI**: Beautiful real-time caption display with animations
4. **Stability Tracking**: Comprehensive statistics and monitoring
5. **Debug Interface**: Detailed information for development and testing

### Phase 2 Features Implemented:
- **WordLevelDiffing**: Sophisticated alignment with fuzzy matching
- **LocalAgreement-2**: Stabilization policy from Whisper-Streaming paper
- **Real-Time Animations**: Smooth word-by-word display with fade effects
- **Confidence Tracking**: Quality-based filtering and monitoring
- **Stability Statistics**: Agreement rates, confidence scores, and duration tracking
- **Enhanced UI**: Separate displays for stable and current transcriptions

### Next Steps:
Proceed to Phase 3 for integration and optimization of the complete pipeline.
