# WhisperLive-Style Overlapping Windows Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document tracks the implementation of the WhisperLive-style overlapping windows approach for real-time speech recognition in Livcap.

## Phase 1: Core Infrastructure ✅
- [x] Create implementation plan
- [x] **AudioWindow.swift** - Data structure for audio windows
- [x] **TranscriptionUpdate.swift** - Data structure for transcription updates
- [x] **OverlappingBufferManager.swift** - Manages 3s sliding windows with 1s step
- [x] **StreamingWhisperTranscriber.swift** - Handles overlapping transcription
- [x] **Test Implementation** - OverlappingCaptionViewModel and OverlappingTestView

## Phase 2: Word-Level Processing ✅
- [x] **WordLevelDiffing.swift** - Extracts new words from overlapping results
- [x] **LocalAgreementPolicy.swift** - Implements LocalAgreement-2 stabilization
- [ ] **RealTimeCaptionViewModel.swift** - Updated ViewModel for overlapping approach
- [ ] **RealTimeCaptionView.swift** - Updated UI for word-by-word display

## Phase 3: Integration & Optimization
- [ ] **AudioManager Integration** - Update AudioManager for streaming
- [ ] **Performance Optimization** - Concurrent processing and memory management
- [ ] **Error Handling** - Robust error handling for overlapping pipeline
- [ ] **UI Polish** - Smooth animations and transitions

## Phase 4: Testing & Validation
- [ ] **Unit Tests** - Test overlapping buffer logic
- [ ] **Integration Tests** - Test full pipeline
- [ ] **Performance Tests** - Measure latency and accuracy
- [ ] **User Testing** - Real-world usage validation

## Phase 5: Production Ready
- [ ] **Code Review** - Final code review and cleanup
- [ ] **Documentation** - API documentation and usage guides
- [ ] **Release Preparation** - Merge to main branch
- [ ] **Deployment** - Production deployment

## Current Status: Phase 1 Complete ✅ - READY FOR TESTING
**Progress: 5/18 tasks completed (28%)**

### What's Ready for Testing:
1. **Core Infrastructure**: All data structures and managers implemented
2. **Test Interface**: OverlappingTestView with debug information
3. **WhisperLive Configuration**: 3s window, 1s step, 2s overlap
4. **Word-Level Diffing**: Basic implementation for extracting new words
5. **LocalAgreement-2**: Basic stabilization policy
6. **Build Success**: All compilation issues resolved

### How to Test:
1. **Open Xcode** and run the project
2. **App will show CaptionView** (normal app flow)
3. **To test overlapping windows**: Temporarily modify AppRouterView.swift to show OverlappingTestView
4. **Click "Start"** to begin recording
5. **Speak continuously** for at least 3 seconds
6. **Watch for new words** appearing every ~1 second
7. **Check console logs** for detailed debugging information
8. **Monitor buffer stats** to see window timing

### Expected Behavior:
- **First window**: After 3 seconds of audio, first transcription appears
- **Subsequent windows**: Every 1 second, new words should appear
- **Overlap handling**: Same audio content transcribed multiple times
- **Word diffing**: Only new words highlighted in blue
- **Stabilization**: Words become stable after confirmation

### Next Steps:
After testing Phase 1, we'll proceed to Phase 2 for enhanced word-level processing and improved UI.
